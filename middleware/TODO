* Is is maybe better not to cache the services but create service instances that the users
  have to delete themselves once done?
* Create WSDL files and ServicePublishers for the default services
* Define a way to find these locally stored WSDL files, i.e. no fixed type url in
  the code.
* Implement some check if the connection to the registry was successful or start the registry on demand
* allow service type shortcuts like storage.rdf.Query which will automatically be extended with the 
  default service type location (in this case most likely the local wsdl file cache)

/**
 * \mainpage The Nepomuk Middleware library
 *
 *
 *
 * The Nepomuk Middleware library provides low-level access to Nepomuk services represented by the
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Service class as well as service publication with the Nepomuk
 * service registry (and thus the whole \a %Nepomuk system on the current desktop) through
 * the Nepomuk::Middleware::ServicePublisher class.
 *
 * The following sections give a quick introduction on how to use the Nepomuk Middleware library.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section knepclient Writing a Nepomuk Middleware client
 *
 * A Nepomuk Middleware client is an application, plugin, or piece of code that uses NEPOMUK services to
 * perform certain tasks (but does not publish services itself).
 *
 * Writing a Nepomuk Middleware client is quite easy. Once first has to create an instance of
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry (the \a Registry class is intended to be used as a singleton
 * and might later be changed to enforce that.) which will then automatically connect to the
 * local Service Registry to retrieve the list of available NEPOMUK services.
 *
 * \code
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry* reg = new Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry( someQOject );
 * \endcode
 *
 * To actually use a service one has to know the service type URL (in future releases this will
 * be simplyfied by some kind of type URL mapping). Say, for example, we want to use an RDF storage
 * service. The RDFRepository service as defined by Nepomuk has the type URL
 * %http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/services/RDFRepository. Thus, to get an RDFRepository service
 * we simply ask the \a Registry and retrieve a generic Nepomuk::Middleware::Service object:
 *
 * \code
 * QString typeUrl = "http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/services/RDFRepository";
 * Service* rdfService = reg->discoverServiceByType( typeUrl );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Service provides a generic interface via the Nepomuk::Middleware::Service::methodCall
 * method. In theory one could do all communication with the service through this simple interface.
 * But since that would be way to complicated (one had to know the exact syntax of the service's API)
 * Nepomuk Middleware provides Nepomuk::Middleware::ServiceWrapper classes for the most common service types.
 *
 * In the case of the RDFRepository service we can simply create an instance of
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Services::RDFRepository as a wrapper around the \a Service object:
 *
 * \code
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Services::RDFRepository rdfServiceWrapper( rdfService );
 * \endcode
 *
 * Now we can use the RDFRepository service easily as if it were a local object.
 *
 *
 *
 * \section knepservice Writing a Nepomuk Middleware service
 *
 * Writing a Nepomuk-KDE service that provides a certain service type is also very easy (if
 * one needs to create a new service type that is not already part of the Nepomuk Middleware library
 * a little more work has to be done. In the future creating service types should be
 * handled by a toolchain within the Nepomuk Middleware framework. For now, however, this has to be done
 * manually. The steps to perform are not documented here and the reader is encuraged to
 * contact the Nepomuk-KDE development team for help).
 *
 * In order to create and publish a service in the local \a %Nepomuk system once has to
 * create an implementation of a Nepomuk::Middleware::ServicePublisher subclass relating
 * to the service type the new service should have.
 *
 * Say, for example, we want to implement an RDFRepository service. To do that we only need to
 * subclass Nepomuk::Middleware::Services::RDFRepositoryPublisher and implement its abstract
 * methods (see Nepomuk::Middleware::ServicePublisher for a code example).
 *
 * Once the new ServicePublisher has been implemented we again create an instance of
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry and then register the new service with a single call to
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry::registerService:
 *
 * \code
 * Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry* reg = new Nepomuk::Middleware::Registry( someQOject );
 * reg.registerService( new MyRdfServicePublisher() );
 * \endcode
 *
 * From that point on \a %Nepomuk clients can see and use the new service.
 *
 * \a Hint: The NEPOMUK_KDE_SERVICE_MAIN(ServiceType) macro can be used to create a very simple
 * wrapping application around a \a ServicePublisher implementation.
